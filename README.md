<div align="center"><strong>What is the Martrix?</strong></div>
 - A maximalist, modern starter for interactive storytelling, for creators who know how to code in Typescript React.
 - Because â€˜small and simpleâ€™ usually means â€˜boring and limitedâ€™. Your posts can and should be more than just plain text; they should be *experiences*. Flex your creative pinions.ðŸª½  **Stop blogging like itâ€™s 1999.**
 - Initially a remix <a href="https://twitter.com/ibaslogic">Ibaslogic</a>â€™s excellent blog starter, but in Typescript, and founded on the stunning Typescript/Next/React starter by <a href="https://twitter.com/jpedroschmitz">JoÃ£o Pedro</a>.
 - Currently in alpha
 - Mostly Iâ€™m just assembling my favourite libraries into a coherent whole; I stand upon the shoulders of veritable giants. I try to get out of the way as much as possible. E.g. you talk directly to Chakra UI, Font Awesome, etc.
