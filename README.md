# What is the Martrix?

 - A maximalist, ultra-modern, opinionated blog starter for rich, interactive storytelling by creatives who code in Typescript React. 
 - Initially a remix a [Ibaslogic’s excellent blog starter](https://twitter.com/ibaslogic), but in Typescript, and founded on the stunning Typescript/Next/React starter by [João Pedro](https://twitter.com/jpedroschmitz). But then I added all my faves. See the ingredient list below :)

## Why another starter?

 - Because ‘small and simple’ usually means ‘boring and limited’. Your posts can and should be more than just plain text; they should be *experiences*. Flex your creative pinions.
 - Because the professional choice for interactive storytelling, the superlative [Vev](https://vev.design), is not open source, and is not optimal for hosting e.g. arbitrary chunks of React. It’s low-code/no-code, which is great for professional journalists, but less great for those of us who don’t feel we’ve done any real work until there’s a `.tsx`. 
 - By contrast, the Martrix is code-first, and can make use of literally any funky JS/TS library you choose to slap into it. **The Martrix is for creatives who code.** 

## Caveats

  - **Currently in alpha!** Caveat Forker.
  - Mostly I’m just assembling my favourite libraries into a coherent whole; I stand upon the shoulders of veritable giants. I try to get out of the way as much as possible. E.g. you talk directly to Chakra UI, Font Awesome, etc. This also means that I hereby punt on most documentation issues; if you have a question about how to use one of the provided libraries, see the documentation for that library.
