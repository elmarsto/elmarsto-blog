<div align="center"><strong>What is the Martrix?</strong></div>

 - A maximalist, modern starter for interactive storytelling and blogging.
 - Initially a remix <a href="https://twitter.com/ibaslogic">Ibaslogic</a>’s excellent blog starter, but in Typescript, and founded on the stunning Typescript/Next/React starter by <a href="https://twitter.com/jpedroschmitz">João Pedro</a>.
 - Super early **ALPHA** grade code. YMMV.  I’m doing this because no one else has.
